PopIn
=====

To get started with PopIn, clone the repository, then run Matlab, and cd into the folder containing this README file.
Finally you can start the launcher by typing "GUI_popin_analysis_from_indentation_test" at the Matlab command prompt.

Features
--------
This Matlab toolbox has been developed to :
- to plot load-displacement curves; 
- to plot Weibull distribution (with 2 parameters) of the 1st or of the 2nd pop-in; 
- and finally to assess the Weibull parameters (mean critical load or mean critical displacement and Weibull modulus).
