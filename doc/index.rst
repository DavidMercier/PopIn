PopIn |matlab| toolbox
=======================

This toolbox has been developed to plot (nano)indentation data and to analyze pop-in events distribution.

With this Matlab toolbox, it is possible to:
    
    * plot load-displacement curves ;
    * fit the load-displacement curves with Hertz model ;
    * plot cumulative (Weibull or time/temperature dependent) distribution of the 1st or the 2nd pop-in.
