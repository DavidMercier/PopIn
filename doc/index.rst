PopIn |matlab| toolbox
=======================

This toolbox has been developed to plot (nano)indentation data and to analyze the pop-in distribution.

With this Matlab toolbox, it is possible to :
    * plot load-displacement curves;
    * plot Weibull distribution (with 2 parameters) of the 1st or the 2nd pop-in;;
    * and finally to assess the Weibull parameters (mean critical load or displacement and Weibull modulus).
