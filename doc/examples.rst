Examples of nanoindentation data
==================================

Format of data
###############

* Only 'Sample' sheet of a .xls files obtained from MTS software - Analyst are accepted.

* You data must only have the loading part from the load-displacement curves of your (nano)indentation results, or 
    it is necessary to have a 'Hold Segment Type' to detect when the loading part is over.

..  warning::
    It is advised to do at least 30 indentation tests to have consistent results.

Example
########

* `MTS-XP_Indcon5um_Al2O3-40nm.xls <https://github.com/DavidMercier/PopIn/blob/master/Indentation_data/MTS-XP_Indcon5um_Al2O3-40nm.xls>`_
    - Data obtained for a sample of ALD-Alumina (40nm) on a substrate of PVD-Aluminum (500nm) deposited on a oxidized silicon substrate.
    - Tests were performed on a Nanoindenter XP MTS with a sphero-conical indenter (radius 5microns), without CSM mode.
